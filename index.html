        SDG 7 aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy by 2030.
        Energy is a cornerstone of progress, powering homes, schools, healthcare, and industries.
        However, millions worldwide still lack access to electricity or clean cooking solutions, relying instead on
        harmful and unsustainable energy sources.
        SDG 7 focuses on accelerating the transition to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and ensuring
        equitable access, particularly in underprivileged and remote communities.
        Achieving this goal is vital for combating climate change, fostering economic growth, and enhancing global
        well-being.

      <h3 class="u-align-center">Renewable Energy Mix: A Global Ranking of Progress</h3>
      <div class="col-md-9 d-flex justify-content-center" align="justify" style="margin:0 auto;">

        <p>
          The renewable energy landscape gains depth when examining the contributions of wind, hydro, solar, and other
          sources across nations. A global ranking shows rising renewable energy percentages, though growth rates vary
          by source, revealing key opportunities and challenges.
          <br>
          Countries like Denmark and Germany excel in wind energy due to abundant resources and infrastructure. Norway
          and Brazil lead in hydroelectric power, leveraging water abundance, while solar energy thrives in sunny
          regions like Australia and the Middle East.

      <h3 class="u-align-center">Broadening the Renewable Energy Story</h3>
      <div class="col-md-9 d-flex justify-content-center" align="justify" style="margin:0 auto;">
        <p>
          Global renewable energy rankings highlight that sustainability requires tailored solutions based on each
          country's unique resources and needs. Slower-growing renewables present opportunities for innovation and
          investment.
          <br>
          As efforts toward SDG 7 advance, embracing diverse energy sources, leveraging local strengths, and tackling
          challenges can ensure meaningful contributions from all renewables, paving the way for a cleaner, sustainable
          future.

          <h3>Correlating Financial Flow with Energy Generation Per Capita</h3>
          The relationship between financial flows and energy capacity generation reveals that initial funding spikes
          often drive sustained growth even with reduced subsequent investments. In hydropower and wind, peaks in
          funding, such as in 2011 and 2010 respectively, resulted in long-term capacity increases with minimal
          additional financial input. Geothermal energy shows a consistent correlation, particularly in countries like
          Indonesia, where steady investments align with sustained growth. Bioenergy, despite smaller financial flows,
          highlights efficiency improvements contributing to capacity gains and suggests a growing role for
          technology-driven advancements.

          These patterns emphasize the critical importance of strategic initial investments to establish infrastructure
          and unlock potential for future growth. As renewable technologies mature, the focus is shifting toward
          efficiency gains, technological innovations, and better resource utilization, enabling more output from fewer
          financial inputs. This trend reflects a sector transitioning from reliance on capital-intensive funding to one
          increasingly characterized by sustainable returns. Aligning investments with these dynamics will be vital for
          accelerating global energy transitions and meeting ambitious climate goals.

        <h3>Advancing Targets 7.a and 7.b for Global Energy Transition</h3>

        The journey toward achieving SDG 7 targets highlights the critical role of international cooperation (7.a) and
        infrastructure expansion (7.b) in advancing global energy transitions. Financial flows to developing countries
        have driven clean energy research, technology transfer, and renewable production, with nations like India,
        Indonesia, and China showcasing significant progress. However, disparities in converting financial investments
        into energy capacity, particularly in less developed and landlocked nations, reveal the need for targeted
        support and efficiency improvements.

        As renewable capacity per capita grows in some regions, leveraging decentralized solutions, green bonds, and
        emerging technologies like marine energy will be key to bridging gaps. Aligning financial strategies with
        tailored infrastructure plans and fostering innovation will ensure equitable, efficient, and sustainable energy
        transitions, achieving the ambitious goals of SDG 7.
