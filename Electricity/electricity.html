            Here we see a heatmap/highlight table of all countries and their changes in median share of access to electricity from 2000- 2022. 
            
            <tableau-viz id="tableauViz"

            But specifically, a few countries made large strides in this timeframe to increase the median access to electricity.

            </tableau-viz>
            Here, the maximum change is for Afghanistan which went from 4.45% in 2000 to an impressive 85.3% in 2022.
        </div>
        <div>
            Infact, for Afghanistan, if we check both the Median access to electricity percentage and the change in the population without access to electricity through the years:
            <tableau-viz id="tableauViz"       
            src='https://public.tableau.com/views/Electricity-Afghanistanchangesareaandline/changesineswatini2?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link'>
            </tableau-viz>
            As mentioed in the chart, the turning point was from 2011 onwards. They were able to massively decrease the population without access to electricity to udner 1 Million. Though it has increased again in 2022, it is worth commending.
        </div>
        <div>
            However, this pattern is not uniform in all the countries, The Democratic republic of congo has managed to massively increase the median access to electricity but the population without access to electricity has also unfortunately increased.

            </tableau-viz>
        </div>
        <div> 
            Infact, Sub Saharan Africa has been the region which had to make the most changes in their policies for electricity as it was in much worse shape than its peers:
            <tableau-viz id="tableauViz"       
            src='https://public.tableau.com/views/Electricity-regionwisemedianaccess/Countrywithmostchangeandpopulationwithaccess3?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link'>
            </tableau-viz>
            This is only true for Sub Saharan Africa which went from 20.43 in 2000 to 52.44 in 2022. However, Western Asia and Northern Africa do not follow this trend, already being at 99.5 in 2000 to begin with. 
        </div>
        <div> 
            Here we see a few countries who contributed the most to the change in Sub Saharan Africa

        </div>
        <div>
            And looking at the choropleth in Sub Saharan Africa through the years, this change has interestingly been contributed to most by coastal countries. 
            <tableau-viz id="tableauViz"

            In general, the top changing countries for median access are shown in the bump chart. Here, the width denotes the absolute population without acces to electricity. It was high for Bangladesh to begin with but unifromly for all top countries, the population without access to electricity has decreased.

        <div> 
            Unfortunately, as of 2022, we still have many countries with over 14 Million without access to electricity:
