                To the left, we see a heatmap/highlight table of all countries and their changes in median share of access to electricity from 2000- 2022. Most countries are trending toward increasing population with access to electricity. There are a few countries that have made large strides such as: Bangladesh, who went from 32% in 2000 to 99.36% in 2022. Unfortunately, a few countries like South Sudan are still only at 5.4% as of 2022.

                During this period, several countries made remarkable progress in increasing the median access to electricity. Notably, Afghanistan demonstrated the most significant improvement, with access rising dramatically from a mere 4.45% in 2000 to an impressive 85.3% by 2022. This substantial growth highlights Afghanistan's efforts and achievements in expanding electrification over the two decades.

                In fact, when examining Afghanistan, it is particularly noteworthy to focus on the median percentage of the population with access to electricity and to analyze the trends in the number of individuals who remain without access to electricity over the years. This perspective allows for a more nuanced understanding of the progress and challenges associated with electrification in the country.
                <br/>
                As depicted in the chart, a significant turning point occurred starting in 2011, marking a period during which Afghanistan achieved substantial progress in reducing the number of individuals without access to electricity to below 1 million. Although there has been a subsequent increase in this figure by 2022, the accomplishments during this period remain noteworthy and deserving of recognition.

                However, this trend is not consistent across all countries. For instance, while the Democratic Republic of Congo has made significant progress in increasing the median access to electricity, the overall population without access to electricity has paradoxically grown during the same period. 
                <br/><br/>
                This underscores the complexity of the electrification challenge, where improvements in access percentages may not always translate to a reduction in the absolute number of individuals without electricity, often due to factors such as rapid population growth.

                In fact, Sub-Saharan Africa stands out as the region that faced the most significant need for policy reforms and infrastructural changes in the electricity sector, given its relatively disadvantaged starting point compared to other regions. This is evident from its substantial progress, with median access to electricity increasing from 20.43% in 2000 to 52.44% in 2022. 
                <br/><br/>
                However, this trend is not mirrored in regions like Western Asia and Northern Africa, which already boasted near-universal access to electricity at 99.5% as early as 2000, requiring far fewer adjustments to maintain their high levels of electrification.

                Here, we observe several countries that played a pivotal role in driving the significant progress in electrification within Sub-Saharan Africa. These nations made substantial contributions to the region's overall improvement in access to electricity, highlighting the impact of targeted policies, investments, and infrastructural advancements in addressing the electrification gap.

                Examining the choropleth map of Sub-Saharan Africa over the years reveals an intriguing pattern: coastal countries have been the primary contributors to the region's significant progress in electrification. This observation suggests that factors such as geographic access to trade, resources, and infrastructural development in these coastal nations have played a pivotal role in driving the changes observed in the region.

                Overall, the countries with the most significant changes in median access to electricity are highlighted in the bump chart. In this visualization, the width of each line represents the absolute population without access to electricity. Notably, Bangladesh initially had a high population without access, but a consistent downward trend is observed across all top-performing countries. This indicates that, despite varying starting points, these nations have successfully reduced the number of individuals lacking electricity access over time.
